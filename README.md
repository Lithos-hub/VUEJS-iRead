# iRead

 iRead is an app with Material Design aesthetic that can be used to get data and interactivity using the Google Books API. 
 The available options in version 1.0 are:

* A books and authors search system (Main section).
* Two storage systems (My Books and Wish List). Books can be added from the search system.
* Newest releases classification by genre (By Genres section).

My point is to expand the posibilities considerably: access to shop/read links for each book; to list books by genre, new releases, best sellers, etc; to be able to write reviews and registering them on Google Books (surely, I would have to add a Google auth system for this. It would be an option only available for logged users.), among many others.

Changelog: 

Version 1.1
         
* Added the following sections: New releases, Top 100, Account summary (Account), Login / Register (Access).
* Aesthetic changes in general.
* Responsive improvements.
